# aihappey-ai

A multi-provider **.NET AI gateway** exposing normalized endpoints for models, media, skills, agents and MCP capabilities.

No smart routing fairy. No shiny admin portal. No hidden logic maze. No code execution.
Just provider capabilities flattened, normalized hard and exposed through open contracts.
Stateless. Boring on purpose.

Access 150k+ models and provider-native capabilities from your favorite client.

**Documentation:** https://docs.aihappey.com/gateway  
**API:** https://ai.aihappey.net

## Quick start

```bash
curl "https://ai.aihappey.net/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Say hi" }
    ]
  }'
```

See the [API documentation](https://docs.aihappey.com/gateway) for endpoints, authentication, request schemas and examples.

Start `aihappey.Windows.exe` and use the same APIs locally at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Jenova Agent API

Jenova discovery exposes agents as `jenova/agent/{agent}` and selectable model overrides as
`jenova/model/{model}`. Use the `jenova` provider metadata/options object for `model`,
`session_id`, `user`, `session_name`, `ephemeral`, `include_progress`, `additional_context`,
and other native Jenova request fields. A model slug used as the request model also requires
`agent` in provider options. Persistent requests return session/run IDs in provider metadata;
pass `session_id` explicitly to continue a session. No conversation state is held by the gateway.
Request-level system prompts and multi-message history are not mapped; configure instructions on
the Jenova agent and supply `session_id` to continue a conversation. Ephemeral requests are
streaming-only; Jenova's cancel endpoint is used when a persistent stream is cancelled, while an
ephemeral run has no session ID to cancel. MCP connection/authentication events and native stream
metadata are passed through to clients; MCP skip/mute actions are not exposed by the current
provider contracts.

## NLPCloud native execution

NLPCloud executes Chat, Chat Completions, Responses and Messages through its native
Unified wrapper. Existing task slugs (`/paraphrasing`, `/summarization`,
`/intent-classification`, `/code-generation`, `/gs-correction`, `/kw-kp-extraction`)
and all `nllb-200-3-3b/translate-to/<language>` slugs retain their endpoint routing.
Code output is Markdown-fenced and keywords are Markdown lists; the original
structured result remains available in provider metadata.

Pass native JSON options in the `nlpcloud` provider metadata/options object.
Unknown fields, nested JSON and explicit nulls are forwarded unchanged. User input,
translation targets and execution stream mode take precedence. `context`, `history`,
summarization `size`, translation `source`, and ASR `input_language` are supported
native options. Unified requests also accept `gpu` and `lang` as URL path controls
(GPU defaults remain unchanged; translation defaults to CPU).

Responses and stream completion metadata retain `nlpcloud.request`,
`nlpcloud.response`, the native endpoint and streaming mode. Chat Completions expose
this envelope through `provider_metadata`; Responses and Messages use their metadata
fields. Upstream usage is normalized when present, with every original usage field
retained. No token counts or costs are estimated when the API does not return them.

`whisper/asr` accepts audio/video URLs natively without downloading or encoding them.
Unified `speech-t5` returns the upstream audio URL without downloading it; the
existing Speech endpoint still downloads generated audio to satisfy its base64
response contract.

Task endpoints use buffered streaming. The existing plain-text/NUL or text SSE
chatbot stream path remains compatible, including JSON responses from deployments
that ignore streaming. Native chatbot streaming, tools and structured response
formats are not documented by the official clients; tools and structured formats
are rejected rather than silently ignored. Canonical sampling/token-limit controls
are reported in `nlpcloud.unsupported_options`, not translated into invented API
parameters. Explicit native options are still passed through for upstream validation.
Asynchronous polling, additional NLP endpoints and embeddings are not added.
All historical slugs remain discoverable, including keyword-extraction slugs for
models other than the currently documented Fine-tuned LLaMA model; upstream
availability is not guaranteed.

API behavior was cross-checked against the supplied documentation and the official
[Python client](https://github.com/nlpcloud/nlpcloud-python/blob/master/nlpcloud/__init__.py)
and [JavaScript client](https://github.com/nlpcloud/nlpcloud-js/blob/master/index.js).
The [official API reference](https://docs.nlpcloud.com/) could not be fetched in this
environment because its host did not resolve. No authenticated live API calls were
performed.

## BaguetteBot persistent agents

BaguetteBot uses Bearer authentication at `https://api.baguettebot.com`.
Configure `X-BaguetteBot-Key` for header-auth gateways or `AIServices:BaguetteBot`
using the existing `ProviderConfig` configuration structure for AzureAuth.
Discovery reads `/v1/models` and `/v1/agents?limit=500` on each request, without
sharing or persisting account-specific agents in catalog snapshots.
Existing agents are exposed as `baguettebot/agent/{agentId}`; underlying models
are exposed as `baguettebot/model/{nativeModelId}` (including native slashes).
Model slugs require `agent_id` in the `baguettebot` provider metadata/options
object, and must match that agent's configured model. Selecting a model never
updates or creates an agent.

Native context length and vision capability are mapped to context/tags.
EUR input/output prices are retained verbatim in model descriptions, **not**
assigned to `ModelPricing`, which cannot identify currency. No exchange rate,
token usage or computer cost is estimated. The native catalog's computer-price
envelope and other fields without a model-contract equivalent are not normalized;
use the native `/v1/models` endpoint for its full pricing/capability envelope.

Only the latest user text is submitted to `/v1/agents/{id}/messages`; previous
turns are not replayed. Reuse the same agent slug/`agent_id` for its persistent
conversation, files and browser sessions. Request-level instructions, system
messages, client tools and response formats are rejected: configure the agent
through BaguetteBot instead. Sampling/token controls and verbosity are not honored;
they are explicitly retained in `baguettebot.unsupported_options` metadata because
UI requests always include temperature and Messages requires `max_tokens`.
Native JSON options (including
unknown fields, objects, arrays and explicit nulls) pass through unchanged.
The latest user text takes precedence over native `content`.
Use `providerMetadata.baguettebot` for UI requests,
`providerMetadata.baguettebot` or `provider_metadata.baguettebot` for Chat
Completions, and `metadata.baguettebot` for Responses and Messages.

Non-streaming requests default to `wait: true`. Both a `202` and a `200` run
with `status: working` are followed by polling agent state, then paginated
conversation reads with `after=message_id`. Set `wait: false` to return the
accepted run immediately with its IDs and `working` status, without invented
output. Unified/Responses statuses are `completed`, `in_progress` or `failed`;
native `done`/`working`/`blocked` remain in `baguettebot.status` and raw metadata.
Pending Chat Completions return no choices or finish reason; pending Messages use
the existing `pause_turn` mapping. Inspect native IDs/status rather than treating
these envelopes as independent chat sessions. Blocked Chat Completions/Messages
fail explicitly because those response contracts lack a failed-operation status.
`timeout_seconds` defaults to 900 (1–86400); `poll_interval_ms` defaults
to 1000. Timeout, caller cancellation, early stream disposal and disconnects
cancel local observation only: they **never stop, delete or modify** the agent
or computer. A disconnected stream while the agent is working fails explicitly;
use returned IDs/history to inspect the still-running task.

Streaming subscribes to native `/events`, awaits `ready`, then dispatches with
`wait: false`. Native `delta` and assistant message snapshots map to text events
using message IDs, without duplicating completed text. Snapshot revisions that
cannot be represented as append-only text remain in native metadata. Status,
tool activity, message updates and computer events are preserved as
`data-baguettebot-*` data events; status/heartbeat reconciliation with current
agent state detects completion, including tasks that finish before dispatch
returns. Tool summaries lack call IDs/arguments, so no correlated tool call
events are invented. Native tool results are retained as provider-executed
result parts and in the raw message list. Markdown, agent/model/message IDs,
agent metadata, task responses and request options survive in provider metadata
and stream finish metadata.

The provider options support these **explicit non-streaming** operations:
`operation: "stop"` calls `/agents/{id}/stop`; `"history"` reads all messages
(optional `after`); `"computer"` reads computer state; `"screenshot"` returns
inline JPEG bytes; `"live"` calls `/computer/live` with the native `live_view`
options object (`interactive`, `ttl_seconds`); `"download"` requires a
`download_paths` array of native computer paths. Signed live URLs and their
expiry are preserved unchanged, without API credentials. Ordinary message
execution can also opt into `live_view` and post-completion `download_paths`.

Latest-turn inline `AIFileContentPart` inputs upload with `Filename` as the
explicit native computer path and bytes, base64 or a base64 data URL as `Data`
(maximum 30 MiB). Mention the path in the task; no text is injected automatically.
Historical files are not re-uploaded. Input HTTP URLs are **never downloaded**.
Explicit downloads return authenticated binary data inline, never an
authenticated URL disguised as a public link. File upload/download endpoints
can boot the computer and incur billing; use them deliberately.

There is no clean agent-CRUD or computer-lifecycle contract here: agent creation,
PATCH updates, deletion and computer start/stop are intentionally not exposed.
One agent has one shared conversation/task stream, not independent chat sessions
or run-scoped cancellation. Busy agents are rejected before submission; callers
must serialize tasks per agent, including tasks submitted outside the gateway.
The API offers no atomic idle-check-and-dispatch or run-specific event filter.
Blocked state is not reported as successful completion. Native errors preserve
HTTP status and JSON error codes/messages (including `402 insufficient_balance`,
`409 computer_not_running`, `429` limits and `Retry-After`); mutating requests
are not retried automatically.

Implementation follows the supplied [API reference](https://baguettebot.com/en/api/docs).
Attempts to fetch the live reference failed because its host did not resolve in
this environment; no authenticated live API verification was performed.
Catalog parsing accepts array, `data`, or endpoint-named array envelopes because
the supplied reference does not specify their exact response shape.
